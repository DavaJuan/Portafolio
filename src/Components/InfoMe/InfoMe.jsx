        <p>
          Since 2021 I realize that programming it is something that I really
          enjoy practicing and learning more every day. But in 2022 I started to
          studying programming in Henry's bootcamp. Learning news and
          challenging technologies. <br />
          Today I prefer to work as a FrontEnd Developer.
