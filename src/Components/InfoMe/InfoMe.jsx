        <p>
        Since 2021 I discovered that programming was something that I really enjoyed practicing and learning more and more.
        But in 2022 I really started studying programming at the Henry's bootcamp.
        Learning many new and challenging technologies for me.
        Among the technologies that I enjoy the most when using them are React, Redux and CSS.
